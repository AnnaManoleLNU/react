# React

My first React project using the tutorials from [YouTube - The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d).

## What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is simple to create a SPA (Single Page Application) with React. The server only needs to send a single HTML file to the browser, and the rest of the application is loaded on the client side. This means that the server does not need to render the HTML for each request, which makes it much faster.
